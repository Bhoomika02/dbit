									Blockchain technology is a form of digitalized, de-centralized public record of all cryptocurrency transactions. 
								Blockchain was designed to record, not just financial-related transactions, but virtually everything of value. <br>
								I'll say it's gold for nerds . It is fascinating how blockchain technology works. That's what keep me up to know more about it.<br>
								The need for decentralization is the key motivation behind the blockchain technology, 
								and decentralization is achieved by distributing the computation tasks to all the nodes of the blockchain network.<br>
